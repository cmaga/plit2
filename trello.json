They must be capable of performing wire inspections in either direction between revenue trains during off-peak hours, and provide the ability to record and transfer wire inspection results. Additionally the MBTA now desires a second trailer car with an OCS Wire spool and a bucket lift to support wire replacement b) Three (3) Crane Cars will be used primarily for track and signal maintenance, including lifting and transporting equipment such as rail, special track-work, signal equipment, and related. The ability to transport rail is mandatory and it is expected that a semi-permanently coupled flat car will be required to provide sufficient storage. NEW: Additionally the MBTA is considering the addition of a non-powered flat car pair for use with the crane car PURPOSE: This cost estimate is intended for capital planning purposes only to support Capital Investment planning. It is anticipated that this estimate will be updated, revised and modified based on the information and data obtained during the Request for Industry Information process that is currently underway. ROUGH ORDER OF MAGNITUDE COST ESTIMATE UPDATED: ESTIMATE NOTES: 1. This estimate is based on the conceptual functionality and performance requirements as they are currently understood. 2.

Due to their high technical scores, Bidder disqualification at this time was not reasonable. Main Overhaul AR10-D14 Floats were also requested in the posted RFP due to the uncertainty of which LOCO's were to be 1st in line for required generator upgrade. Due to the gap in tech scoring between the 2 top tech scorers and rest of the bidders, a request was made to the 2 top scorers to answer if the \"no bid\" submission by both bidders for Main Overhaul AR10-CA5 floats was accurate. Sherwood responded with a corrected bid due to the recent ability to bid on Main Overhaul AR10-CA5 Float. Magnetech responded to our clarification request with \"no bid\" - with response \"At the current time, Magnetech does not have a CA 5 in our core pool. We could not supply the AR10-CA5.\"  It is unspoken but widely known that the Bidders have option to acquiring the unit and offer for resale to MBTA, should they choose.
